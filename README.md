# YouTube Search Engine
In this project we used the YouTube Data API v3 to build a video search engine.

We will use the 'search . list' method to do this. We will also implement 'FancyBox', which is a lightbox script. This will allow use to have the video open on our site instead of being redirected to YouTube.

Features/Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Youtube Data API v3, jQuery $.get() request, inserting HTML via html() method
